This is a text document to hold the goals of the current git branch.

Right now, that's implementing tooltips on the sidenav.

In order to do this, I need to create tooltips, and have them
show when I mouseover a sidenav icon. This will require state.

In order to use state, I have to extend a component- ideally,
a higher level one so later ones can import it.

It's possible that I could use portals.
